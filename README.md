# CS767_ML_project Image classification
### CNet classification network predicts the classes of animals. We have two classes of dogs and cats. Given any image of pets, the application should be able to read it as data and predict the label.
#### The project is dedicated to design and analyze a model for binary classification. The data is from Kaggle competition dogs-vs-cats. It contains 25000 images labeled correctly.
#### The goal of the project is to solve the CAPTCHA challenge and demonstrate vulnerability of the system.
#### The objective is to design and analyze a model for binary classification
